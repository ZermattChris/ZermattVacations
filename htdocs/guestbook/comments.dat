You have thought of everything that anyone could need - from bathrobes to a travel cot!  Thank you for a wonderful holiday and we wish you every success.
2004-10-08 12:22		|~~|Paul, Loretta, Corey and Ryan Vernier	|~~|United States	|~~|Hi Ashley and family,<br />After a day of hiking in the most breathtaking area in the world, it was pure joy to come "home" to Haus Alpine. It was immaculate and the best stocked apartment we have ever stayed in. We couldn't have wanted or needed anything more. The view of the Matterhorn was awesome. <br />Ashley, I would like to thank you for making us feel at home. You went above and beyond with many personal touches that made us feel more like friends than renters. <br />Take care,<br />The Vernier Family<br />Raleigh, NC USA
2004-10-08 12:31		|~~|Steve Rauch								|~~|United States	|~~|Ashley:<br />What a wonderful apartment and what a great host you were.  The carriage ride pickup at the train station was a wonderful start to our visit to Zermatt.  The views from the apartment are breathtaking.  And of course, the apartment is truly first class.  Your extra touches made our stay feel like we were home. This was our third visit to Zermatt (our most favorite place in our travels around the world).  The town is blessed to have gained you and your family.  Thank you so much.<br /><br />Steve, Carol and Curtis Rauch<br />Colorado Springs,Colorado USA

Many thanks for your kind hospitality in welcoming us to Zermatt and providing us with a fully functioning, immaculately clean and visually stunning apartment (not to mention that we only had a few steps to take to soak in the breathtaking view of the Matterhorn!).  We would certainly highly recommend it!  We both wish you every success with the apartment.<br />Graeme and Avril<br />Moneyreagh, Northern Ireland
2005-02-05 18:22		|~~|Les and Ethie Green						|~~|United States	|~~|Dear Ashley, <br />What a fabulous time we had in Zermatt.  Your apartment is wonderful, so bright, cheery, and immaculate.  Having breakfast, looking out the patio window and watching the sun rise onto the Matterhorn was spectacular. Then watching the Gornergrat pass by was special. Jon loved waving at the skiers who looked half asleep getting a startled smile.<br />Thank you for helping with our laundry, and making recommendations for ski rentals and clothing purchases when our luggage failed to arrive.<br />You are an outstanding host and we will heartily recommend your accomodations to our friends who travel to Switzerland. We'll be contacting you on our next trip back.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Les, Ethie, Jon, Danielle and Aaron

Zermatt is quite simply a unique part of the world - both breathtaking and inspiring - and the exceptional quality of the apartment together with your personal brand of hospitality made for a very special experience.

The view of the Materhorn was exceptional and the terrace outside was great for the kids. We had a great time in Zermatt, we enjoyed the excellent facilities you and the village have to offer and we hope to be back. When we do we will be calling you! It was a memorable holiday!<br /><br />Best wishes, Costas
2005-03-17 01:49		|~~|Susan and Robert Johnson				|~~|United States	|~~|Dear Ashley,<br />We cannot begin to thank you for the exceptional accommodation you provided us last week in Haus Alpine.  Our/your apartment was immaculate and very well equipt. As owners of a rental property in a resort location on the Delaware beaches here in the states, we are totally aware of what it takes to set up and manage a property such as yours in Haus Alpine. You had every detail addressed: high quality kitchen equipment, lots of books and information, DVDs, comfortable linens, little kitchen extras, beautiful bathrooms and personal attention to our needs. We are also so glad we took advantage of your shopping for us and the basic foodstuff that you laid in before we arrived.<br /><br />When our luggage was lost, you were right there with assistance of every sort! I can still see you coming into the apartment with a big bag full of extra clothes and ski attire from your family for us!  You worked with the railroad, were diplomatic with some trying baggage handling staff, and made us feel that without question you would go the extra mile to ensure that our vacation was successful. You made us feel like there was no question too trivial or too difficult for you to handle.  Even our kids said that all we had to do was call Ashley and any question we had would be answered, any issue addressed.<br /><br />So, we thank you for a most fantastic vacation! We are already planning for a return one summer soon for some hiking and warm weather adventures. If anyone considering renting Haus Alpine would like to hear first hand how wonderful staying there is, please refer them to us.  Rest assured that we will tell them there is no better place to stay in Zermatt, no better host to have than you.  Many thanks to you for a wonderful stay in a wonderful place.  We hope that we will see you again SOON!<br /><br />Regards,<br />Susan, Robert, and Brian Johnson
2005-04-07 17:44		|~~|Sara and friends						|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|Beautifully appointed apartment with a lovely Matterhorn view.

2005-05-25 11:12		|~~|Ulla and Stefan Swanström				|~~|Finland			|~~|Dear Ashley,<br />We would like to thank you for all your efforts last February to make our stay such a success!

2006-02-14 23:11		|~~|Dave Keeley								|~~|United States	|~~|Thank you again for making our visit to Zermatt such a wonderful experience.  <br />Your hospitality and attention to detail are rivaled only be the quality and comfort of the property we rented.  Your anticipation of our needs was truly exceptional.  Your recommendations about places to ski and dine were very much appreciated and proved to be everything you told us to expect. I can't imagine anyone visiting Zermatt and <br />not having a wonderful time, but you helped make our trip perfect.<br />  <br />If you ever visit the Seattle area, we would welcome an opportunity to return the favor.<br />  <br />Thank you for everything.<br />  <br /> Dave Keeley
2006-02-19 16:09		|~~|Mikula Monika							|~~|Switzerland		|~~|Liebe Ashley<br />Unsere Skiferien in Zermatt wurden zu einem unvergesslich tollen Erlebnis. Die Wohnung im Haus Susanna entsprach völlig unserem Geschmack. Die Lage mit Matterhornblick, die neue, sehr saubere Wohnung, sowie die moderne, klare Einrichtung wussten wir sehr zu schätzen.Wir möchten uns für die kompetente Beratung, den liebenswürdigen Briefkontakt und die nette Betreuung herzlich bedanken.

2006-03-07 06:28		|~~|Amy and Donny Peters					|~~|Netherlands		|~~|Dear Ashley <br /><br />We want to thank you for taking such good care of us during our recent trip to Zermatt. You went out of your way to accommodate us at a very busy time, digging deep into the offerings pool to find several housing arrangements for us at the very last minute when we were in a real bind.  We couldn't have imagined a more beautiful accommodation - the views were spectacular and the home was magnificent with candles, fresh linens, a wood-burning fireplace stocked with kindling and wood and a lovely bottle of wine. Thanks too for freely sharing your knowledge about the mountain, about restaurants, about local activities with us.  You were kind to check in on us from time to time during our visit, making sure our every desire was taken care of. Your innate sense for quality service will take you far!  Best of luck to you and your family!!
2006-04-20 04:31		|~~|whyte									|~~|Australia		|~~|My family and I stayed at House Susanna in Zermatt for two weeks in January 2006. We had a wonderful time in Zermatt and loved "our house". It was perfect for our holiday, so easy to keep tidy (even with three young adult children) and had everything in it that we might need. In fact, I came home with some decorating ideas that I have used! It was so lovely to wake up in the morning and see the sun shining on the peak of the Matterhorn. At first we thought it a bit far from the slopes, but we soon mastered the local free drop off bus and left our skis and boots at the top of the Matterhorn ski area so didn't have to cart them around with us. Also we were thankful for the walk to and from town as it meant we could eat and drink at the great restaurants all over Zermatt....without putting on the kilos (always a worry for me!)The walk also provided some very good talking time for the 5 of us and we often met other people along the way. Ashley was so helpful with local knowledge advice, maps, some translating, even taking the time to ski with me and encourage me down the slopes! House Susanna was a great place to stay and I hope your holiday will be as good as ours was. Good luck!<br />Regards,<br />Karen
2006-12-31 12:50		|~~|Ron Kaufman								|~~|Singapore		|~~|This was our first visit to Zermatt, and we are SO glad we met Ashley Wyss through the internet before our arrival. She was and is a master of providing helpful, kind and proactive service. All communications were done professionally and with a genuine personal touch. From meeting her at the train station, I knew we were in Great Hands. The apartment was spotless, her referrals were all top-notch, and our overall vacation was a dream come true. We will CERTAINLY visit Zermatt again, and will certainly do so with Zermatt Vacations. VERY highly recommended. <br /><br />Ron Kaufman & Family|
2007-04-07 19:24		|~~|Adi Savir								|~~|Israel			|~~|Dear Ashley,<br />We arrived home safely with a big smile on our faces. It was a great week staying at the Altesse topped by a fabulous last day of sunshine and fresh snow. The Altesse was a real spoil, very comfortable with fantastic surroundings.<br />Your warm true caring helped us feel even more comfortable. Your recommendations were great and we will not forget the gray day that turned into a sunny one just because you urged us not to stay in the apartment.<br />Best regards,<br />Adi Savir
2007-04-12 23:14		|~~|Miguel del rio							|~~|Chile			|~~|Dear Ashley:<br /><br />As promissed I wanted to post in your guestbook te let everybody know that spending a ski week in Chalet Altesse was just wonderful.<br />In addition to good ski conditions I must say that the apartment was as to stay there forever. Not only the apartment but also the wellness area which was just perfect.<br />We will never forget how you helped us even  before our arrival by getting involved in our train tickets reservations, the grocery shopping you did for us the day of our arrival, the daily fresh bread delivered to our door, how you reacted when we asked for an iron and you returned the same evening including some DVD's for our entertainment.<br />My wife, our two kids and myself are already planning to come back in the near future. No doubt we will try to repeat our stay at Chalet Altesse.<br />Thanks again for this great vacation<br /> Miguel del Río
2007-07-17 00:06		|~~|jon molyneaux							|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|Dear Ashley,<br />What a great week! Mike, Dave and myself had a fabulous time at Altesse. The comforts of the apartment were most welcome after a hard day 'on the hill'. The view of the Matterhorn, from the balcony, was truly wonderful. We would certainly recommend booking a holiday with you, Ashley. Thank you for looking after us all so well!<br />Best Regards, Jon, Mike & Dave<br />
2008-04-04 12:36		|~~|irina lavruk							|~~|Ireland			|~~|For anyone who considers a holiday in Zermatt I would highly recommend Chalet Altesse. The quality and comforts of the apartments and the spa, the view from the balcony, the position (the Klein Matterhorn station is reachable on skis in a couple of minutes, snow conditions permitting, centre of Zermatt only five minutes away by ski-bus) is six-star. But it's the host who makes it really stand out - Ashley is the best - warm and attentive, always ready to help. Thank you Ashley, we had the bestest time.<br /><br />Irina and Family
2008-07-09 16:01		|~~|Janet & John							|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|We have just spent a fantastic week in the chalet Altesse. The apartment is everything you could wish for and the view of the Matterhorn is superb. If we could move in from tomorrow we would not hesitate!<br />Ashley could not have been more helpful and went out of her way to make this one of our best holidays.<br />We cannot wait to return.
2008-07-20 19:31		|~~|Leon & Joyce							|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|What a combination- Altesse, an immaculate, comfortable well appointed apartment, a spectacular unobstructed view of the Matterhorn and Ashley, who brings it all together and makes it all work for a wonderful vacation.<br />Thanks Ashley, hope to see you agin next year.
2009-04-28 10:25		|~~|Wendy Hughes							|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|Had a lovely week in Haus Zenith at Easter. Weather and snow were both amazing, and the apartment was fantastic. We loved waking up to the views! Thanks to Ashley for meeting us, (later than expected), and making us feel so welcome, and for her great advice on places to eat and things to do! We would have loved to stay for another week, as we felt so at home! Hopefully, we will be back!
2009-08-21 05:02		|~~|Terrance Carter							|~~|Canada			|~~|Re: Haus Alpine<br /><br />Dear Ashley,<br /><br />Thank you for your gracious hospitality during our stay at Haus Alpine this summer. The accomadation was superb and the view of the Matterhorn was spectacular. You went out of your way to make our family feel welcome and provided warm and personal assistance at all times of the day when we needed help. A marvelous experience for our whole family. I would highly recommend a stay at haus Alpine for any one thinkig of vacationing in Zermatt.<br /><br />Best regards, Terry
2009-11-24 10:54		|~~|John Cox								|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|Dear Ashley,<br /><br />Once again you provided a fantastic service and superb accommodation for our visit to Zermatt. This year we stayed in Haus Alpine and were delighted with the whole experience. The apartment was immaculate and the views were stunning with easy access to the town.<br />Your help and attention to detail again exceeded all expectations.<br />I would recommend anyone thinking of visting Zermatt putting "Zermatt Vacations" at the top of their list!
2010-02-22 09:42		|~~|Jo & Justin Parker						|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|Ashley<br /><br />Absolutely fantastic week!  This time staying at Haus Viktoria with your recommendation. Thank you!!<br /><br />The location could not have been better so close to the main station and Gornergrat train, which takes you straight up onto the slopes. We could not believe how quiet (even with it being half term week) this apartment was given its location.  It really made for an enjoyable, peaceful and relaxing base.<br /><br />Perfect size apartment for the family, given 3 teenage children were in tow. <br /><br />As always you were there to meet us in the early hours (sorry our flight was delayed) but a truly seamless service!  Thank you so much for making our week.<br /><br />2nd year in a row we have now been to Zermatt (Altesse in 2009) and if we are lucky enough to hit the slopes again next year we wouldn't think of going to anyone else! We would recommend anything on your recommendations time and again.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Justin, Jo, Ellie, Grace & Archie
2010-03-14 16:00		|~~|Anne Grant and Fiona					|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|Thank you very much for your support and advice. We had a wonderful holiday and the location of the appartment certainly helped. Being so close to the mountain station was a big bonus. The appartment was lovely and spotlessly clean and had everything we were looking for. The steam shower was excellent! Hopefully we will visit again soon.
2010-06-02 21:59		|~~|Michele Lerner							|~~|United States	|~~|We stayed at Alpine Haus for four days for our daughter's wedding in May and cannot say enough about how spectacular the accomodations were and how much help Ashley provided us throughout our stay. She found three apartments to accommodate all our family friends - each perfect. We all enjoyed cooking and entertaining in the apartments. Ours had a perfect view of the Matterhorn and was a delightfully easy walk to every place we needed to go in town and to the train stations. Our place was spotlessly clean, outfitted with everything we could need - including a patio where we sat in the sun and admired a world-class view. Thanks Ashley for making our daughter's dreams come true!
2010-09-19 17:31		|~~|John and Niki							|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|We had a fantastic week staying in Haus Alpine in early September. This is a beautifully appointed apartment in a great location. Everything you need is provided and this is a real home from home (with the added bonus of a  Matterhorn view!) <br /> Ashley is the perfect host and we cannot recommend this apartment and the service highly enough.<br /><br />John and Niki
2010-12-18 17:31		|~~|Emily 									|~~|United States	|~~|We stayed at the Haus Alpine for a short 2 night visit in December 2010. Ashley was the most accomodating and thoughtful host! She arranged for a few people from our group to have skiing lessons, she showed us where to rent skis and buy ski passes, and she even gave us pointers on the best places to eat in town! We arrived hungry and she was sure to have some snacks for our arrival, as the only grocery store in town does not open until 2:00 pm. <br/><br/>The apartment was beautiful - the view of the Matterhorn from the living room is breathtaking. I look forward to the next time I visit Zermatt and I know that I will be staying at the Haus Alpine with the Wyss family as our hosts! Thanks again for everything!

2011-03-13 11:35		|~~|Laura Sanders 							|~~|France			|~~|We stayed at Haus Zenith over the February ski holidays with my husband, myself and our two daughters (2 years and 8 months). The apartment is absolutely gorgeous and the view is sublime. True, it’s a bit of a hike to get up to the house, but the elevator works quite well to get heavy things up the hill and people can absolutely use it as well if you’re feeling tired. Ashley has got to be one of the nicest people I’ve ever met. She’s extremely meticulous with keeping the apartments exceedingly clean an making sure that you are completely taken care of. She went out and purchased a stair gate so our little daughter wouldn’t run up and down the stairs.  <br /><br />We loved Zermatt, loved Haus Zenith and loved Ashley.
2011-03-19 05:02		|~~|David, Lisa, Holly and Skip				|~~|United States	|~~|We were so impressed with Haus Alpine and our host Ashley. The accommodation was spacious, clean and comfortable. Ashley provided many extra amenities, included recommendations for restaurants, hiking trails, etc. She felt like a friend by the end of the week!<br />Most places were easy to get to, but be prepared for lots of walking and hills throughout all of Zermatt. The view from the apartment was amazing and even the climb to get there seemed easy after a while. We would definetely stay there again.


2011-06-19 22:12		|~~|Anita and Russy Sumariwalla				|~~|United States	|~~|Because of construction/noise issues we decided not to take the Alpine Haus apartment which we had booked several months before our visit in May 2011. Ashley offered us a full refund but we decided to go to Zermatt anyway as she offered an alternative apartment -- Zenith -- which was absolutely fantastic with everything you may need. The view of Matterhorn from the apartment rooms was simply unbeatable. Our time in Zermatt was memorable. Ashley was so kind and obliging. She met us at the train station when we arrived and again at 5:00 in the morning on the day of our departure. In between we had several friendly visits with Ashley over wine/tea. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Switzerland with our Swiss Rail Pass which allowed us to travel anywhere in the country.
2011-07-21 05:02		|~~|Carole and Hans Naeff					|~~|United States	|~~|Haus Alpine was very clean and well located.  Tastefully decorated, very modern and attractive. Highly recommend!
2011-08-28 05:02		|~~|David, Lisa, Holly and Skip				|~~|Germany			|~~|We stayed at Haus Alpine for 4 days. We were met at the appartment by Ashley and given hints on things to do and places to visit. The appartment was in a super condition, very clean and fully stocked. It was even more spacious and modern than the pictures in the internet suggested. There were also many nice touches that we appreciated; i.e. Molton Brown bathroom products. Overall we were very impressed with the apartment and the care Asley took to make sure we were settled in and feeling at home. Thanks for a memorable holiday.

2012-04-10 09:32		|~~|Karen Farrell							|~~|United Kingdom	|~~|Thank you for making 2weeks in Zermatt memorable. Your apartment was very comfortable and well equipped and in close proximity to skiing and everything else we enjoyed that Zermatt had to offer. Waking up every morning to a view of the Matterhorn is hard to beat! A special thanks to you Ashley - you provided all the little extra touches which were beyond the call of duty!
2012-04-10 17:12		|~~|Waleeporn (Pui)							|~~|Thailand		|~~|I and family and my friends total 13 members stayed at duplex Haus Zenith-Heidi and Haus Zenith-Lily. Everything is splendid! Apartment itself locates at the right location of Zermatt where you can see the Matterhorn at your terrace, bedrooms, etc. It locates in the west-side of Zermatt and about 5-7 mins walk from the train station and central which is no problem and easily reached by foot as Zermatt is a small town. Even there are many steps to climb up but all of your tiredness will disappear when you see the beautiful Matterhorn and whole village upfront. The Apartment also has the private lift to facilitate this. Apartment looks better than photos. It’s spacious, clean, comfortable, and well-designed. Ashley is best owner we’ve ever met. She welcomed us at the late night on arrival and offered all services to make sure that we have a great time. Her services is much more than 6 stars hotel can offer! We highly recommended you to visit Zermatt and stay here. Thank you Ashley to make our holiday the best holiday in 2012! We will definitely go back and stay here again :)

2012-04-29 22:37		|~~|Carly Kear						    	|~~|United States   |~~|We had a wonderful time in Zermatt! Thank you for going to such amazing lengths to ensure that our stay was delightful. You are a superb host and your apartment was incredibly well appointed. We had one glorious afternoon on the deck, sun beating down, the mountain in full view, champagne and chocolate in hand. Could life get any better? I would highly suggest any potential renter to book this now!

2012-08-24 11:12		|~~|Marcel Amariglio						|~~|Isreal          |~~|We spent six weeks this July-August in Zem Waldhus and it was a dream vacation.<br/><br/>The appartment is luxurious and equipped with more than we ever imagined or needed!Needless to say spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. The location is perfect for all activities on the mountain and one feels at the same time in the middle of the village and above it all.<br/><br/>Ashley has been a real treasure catering to all our needs including baby siting by her lovely daughters which made our stay so much more enjoyable and worry-free!<br/><br/>Looking forward to returning,and highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Marcel

When I woke up the first morning with the Matterhorn right outside our window I actually gasped!!!What a sight when the sun rises and lights the Horn. Ashley took a lot of time and care with us to ensure our vacation was perfect. She gave up great hike ideas and dinner ideas. We will definitely be returning!

From the moment we arrived Ashley made us feel welcome and comfortable. She was always helpful, available, and informative. We have never before received such kind service when we've rented an apartment. The apartment itself is spacious, modern, clean and very well appointed. Every effort was made to provide us with the extra's that made us feel at home. Alpine is well located - just a short walk's distance into town, close to shopping and skiing. If you are going to Zermatt, this is a perfect place to stay. <br/><br/>Thank you again, Ashley, for making our stay so enjoyable. <br/><br/>Fondly, Judy

Everything was spotlessly clean and there were little touches like house shoes, nespresso galore and welcome-bottle of red wine. We were blessed with perfect weather for skiing so pretty much just slept there but for breakfast we enjoyed the view at the Matterhorn. Communication with Ashley was excellent and last day we could have a shower after skiing and a late check out. <br/><br/>We had a lovely stay and would definitely recommend this place, thank you Ashley!

Our ski vacation at Haus Victoria was simply fabulous! The apartment was just lovely, modern, very clean and so well appointed. Its central location, right across from the Gornergrat station and ski bus stop, as well as its close proximity to everything in town --shops, restaurants, bars, ski rentals, supermarket -- contributed towards making our stay both incredibly fun and super smooth for the entire family. Your personal touch, is well, what can I say? From having your daughter Amy greet us at the station when we arrived, to your checking in on us regularly to ensure we had everything we needed, to your invaluable advice regarding restaurants, ski trails, activities in town, etc., and right down to taking care to send back our forgotten Blackberry... We WILL be back!!! <br/><br/>All the best in the meantime, <br/><br/>Maureen, Tim, Chris (12) and Claire (9)

Ashley was a superb host; from the minute she picked us up at the train station to the send-off on the final day, we were grateful to have Ashley’s hospitality as well as Haus Zenith that created our memorable vacation at Zermatt. Not only did Ashley provide us with useful information about the apartment, the supermarket, the weather, the activities and so on, she shared with us her favorite restaurant and bakery, if we were to dine out for breakfast or dinner, everything that we need to know of the cosy little village, we were completely well informed. Ashley did a brilliant job taking care of her guests. On our arrival to Haus Zenith, we were extremely pleased to find that the condition of the apartment matches exactly what was shown on the Internet, truly modern and sleek. Upon arrival at Haus Zenith, we were taken on a tour around the house, where Ashley showed us each and every room, gave clear explanations on how to operate the washer, dryer etc. The bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen equipments etc, are all in excellent working condition, even the shower gel provided are of Molton Brown, we could not have expected more. The apartment is so well maintained that we loved every aspect of living in the apartment. Unlike other rented apartments that we come across which do not normally live up to expectations, this one did. In fact, Haus Zenith went beyond what we could have imagined for a rental place. With the oven, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer working so fine and being so clean, we felt truly at home, we wished that our stay at the apartment was longer.   Ashley dropped by daily to check if we needed anything at all, and on one rainy morning, she came by personally to inform us of the snow falling at Gornergrat, we were so so so thrilled!  2 incidents left me very strong impressions. Firstly, the luggage lift was broken due to helicopter crashing into it, this was only prior to our arrival. While Ashley went to get us at the train station, her teenage daughter was waiting to receive us at the foot of the apartment to help us with the crazily heavy luggage, filled with winter wear. Even thought we had 4 strong men in our group, her daughter quietly lugged a heavy one all the way up and it was only when i was at the stairway did i see her in sweats managing the heavy piece. I thought that was admirable of her effort and attitude. Secondly, our group turned up with an extra guest without informing Ashley due to the very short notice. With a smiley face, she assured us that it was not a problem at all, quickly proceeded to make extra bed and prepare towels and linens for the additional guest, to make sure that we would be comfortably settled.   Only when we have met our fair share of house owners/agents who should be obliged to take care of their guest’s needs during their stay, yet irresponsibly disappear after the handing of the keys or receiving of rental payments, we find it very comforting to have chanced upon Haus Zenith and to meet Ashley, comforting to know that your host is this dependable, and always a call away to help when situation like such arises.   Our satisfaction with Ashley and Haus Zenith went well beyond words. We would strongly recommend this place if anyone ever visits Zermatt. <br/><br/>Thank you for attending to us, Ashley. All the best to you and your family.
